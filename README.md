# Chains.EVM

Chains.EVM provides a neat interface for users and allows them to add various [EVM-based](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/) chains to their web3 enabled wallets like metamask. Chains.EVM draws inspiration from and uses [EIP-3085](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3085) and [EIP-3326](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/eip-3326-wallet-switchethereumchain/5471).
